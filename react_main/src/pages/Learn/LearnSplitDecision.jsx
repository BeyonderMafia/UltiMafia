              In Split Decision, all players are randomly split among two rooms,
              as well as split among two teams: Red and Blue. One player is
              assigned the role of President, and another is the Bomber. The game
              plays over a series of rounds, and in each round each room will
              elect a leader. Those leaders will then meet together and choose one
              or more players (the hostages) to swap between the rooms for the
              next round.
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
              As the game progresses the rounds will get shorter and the number of
              players swapped between rooms will decrease. It is the goal of the
              Red team for the President and the Bomber to end up in the same room
              after the last round. It is the goal of the Blue team for them to
              end up in different rooms.
