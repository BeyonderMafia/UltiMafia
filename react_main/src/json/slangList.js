Roles which have abilities that trigger "upon being condemned" will function normally, even if their vote is overturned; however, if such a role is the target of the overturn, they will not react in time and die without being able to use their power. Synonymous with OT. Governors and Crooks use this action, although Crooks cannot Overturn a vote if the initial target was mafia. Hangmen use a special kind of Overturn which spares a Town target, or kills the Hangman and the non-Town target.',

  Recruit: {
    definition:
      "Recruit: An action which changes a player's faction without changing their role. A non-meeting Mafia-aligned player who gets recruited at the beginning of the game to the Liaison's faction can no longer win with the Mafia and instead wins with all other Liaison faction members. Some role conversions automatically recruit a player to another faction: a Defector may convert to Mafia, which automatically recruits them to the Mafia faction because that is the assigned faction of the Mafia role.",
